**Installing the plugin**

Activate like any other plugin and done. Visit the plugin settings page to choose your options.

More info on [installing WP plugins](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#installing-plugins)


**Still getting extra images?**

If you are noticing extra images that cannot be disabled by the plugin, most likely they are being generated by some other plugin or maybe your theme. In that case, you would need to do some investigating to determine which plugin or theme is causing it to happen. This plugin disables only the image/sizes that WordPress creates by __default__. So any extra image sizes added by other plugins and themes will need to be disabled in some other way. If in doubt, ask your plugin or theme provider. They will know the best steps.


**Uninstalling**

To uninstall/remove the plugin, visit the Plugins screen, deactivate and delete the plugin. All plugin options will be removed from the database when the plugin is removed via the Plugins screen. Also, the plugin does not remove any existing images at any time. So it is safe to delete the plugin, it never touches any images.



== Upgrade Notice ==

To upgrade this plugin, remove the old version and replace with the new version. Or just click "Update" from the Plugins screen and let WordPress do it for you automatically.
